# simply-done
Helping people be more productive.
Currently developing this as part of my Computer Science project. 

Download the latest compiled .jar file <a href="https://goo.gl/BoqkpR">here</a>.

Or download the latest compiled .exe file <a href="https://github.com/DMeechan/Simply-Done/raw/master/download/Simply%20Done.exe">here</a> (Windows only)

The compiled .exe file has a custom icon and can be pinned to your taskbar.

<b>Current list of features I'd like to add in the near future:</b>
- Make action buttons light up when hovered over
  - As shown <a href="https://gyazo.com/746ce5e7b765e6cc8a5db5af674136b0">here</a> in Polymail
  - If I use a similar style, it'll look *amazingly* clean
- Drag tasks to re-arrange
- Change .exe's icon hover-over text from app description to app title
- When timer is running, add ability to mark currently-active task as done or change its estimated time on the fly
- Preferences to change:
  - Enable / disable overtime
  - Maximum and minimum task length slider values
  - Default new task colour
  - Enable / disable sounds
  - Launch on startup
  - Swap whether big timer is for the task timer or total timer
  - Light / dark colour scheme
- Add tags to tasks for filtering, sorting, and data analysis
- Record more user data about frequency of completion, overtime, etc.
- Add analytics page showing data about how much they get done
  - Potentially with HTML output?
- Add recurring tasks
- Faster new task creation
  - Instantly save changes when task name, length, and colour picker are changed
- Find a way to get new task slider colour to change from green (!)
- Fix formatting of task timer labels so separator lines always line up
- Add support for window resizing
- Add a stealth mode (?) where the countdown timer is very small, semi opaque, and always on-top, so the timer ism't massive and distracting
  - Add settings slider to adjust % opacity
- Add fullscreen mode
- Improve sounds that are played
- Set task backgrond colour to task's set colour?
- Add cloud synchronisation support 
  - Account creation
  - Sync with servers
  - Enable cross-platform sync later on
- Add Android support
- Add iOS support
- Add web support (?)
- Make installable (and uninstallable) natively on Windows and Mac
- Fix bug where big timer starts a fraction already through the clock...
- Increase focus on styling via CSS stylesheets, not CSS within code

Probably got enough features here to keep myself occupied for a while... let me know if you have any suggestions or think any of these features should be priotitised. 

Pull requests are welcome.
